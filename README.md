Idea: Website that shows info about (enthusiast) cars. Every car has a page where there are photos of good examples, maybe some history, average price, what to look out for when buying, common faults, some basic specs etc. You can search for a specific car in the searchbar, there will be some featured on the main page.

Update: No Searchbar, does not fit with the current vibe of the site.

Update 2: Basically done, don't know what else to add.
